   * Version 1. IIT Debates is a site to facilitate meaningful dialogue in
   * between acquintances on issues of mutual concern. I am more likely to be
   * interested in things that my friends are interested in, and I will be
   * more interested in their opinions.
   * Give users the optiond of
   * 1. starting a debate
   * 2. following a debate
   * 3. follow a debater
   * 4. rate debates, debaters (implicitly)
   * For any debate, the user will have the option of starting a new point, 
   * rebutting a point, supporting a point
   * Each debate has a time frame and then the one with the most points wins (?)
